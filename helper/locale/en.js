        "What is pornography addiction Desc": "Porn addiction, also known as cybersex addiction or internet sex addiction, has been proposed as a sexual addiction characterized by virtual internet sexual activity that causes serious negative consequences for one's physical, mental, social, and\/or financial well-being.\n\nAs a form of a compulsive behavior, it can be identified by three criteria: the failure of making a decision about engagement in the behavior, obsession with the behavior, and the inability to stop the behavior despite negative consequences.",
        "How do we determine your results?": "How do we determine your results?",
        "How do we determine your results Desc": "Your proprietary test results are based on the following four categories, listed in descending order of importance.\n\n1. Severity of addiction.\n\n2. Age (in years) that you became ‘hooked’.\n\n3. Affect of addiction on personal, social and professional life.\n\n4. Duration of addiction.\n\nYour addiction percentage is based on the statistical difference between your results and the results of a control group who do not self-identify as ‘addicted’ nor present any of the symptoms commonly associated with pornography addiction.\n\nWhile support for pornography addiction is mounting, due to it’s novelty it is currently a disputed topic among health experts. Your results from this test should not be treated as a professional or psychiatric diagnosis, but rather as a strong indication that you may have an addiction problem in need of addressing.\n\nWhile the psychiatric and mental health field continues to better understand pornography addiction, a number of studies (1)(2)(3) have found neurological markers of addiction in internet porn users, which is consistent with a large body of research finding similar markers in other kinds of problematic internet users. There’s a growing consensus among the top addiction neuroscientists worldwide that internet porn use alters some users brains in some of the same ways substance abuse does, and that these brain changes are consistent with the established addiction model."

        "Did You Know1": "Pornography significantly distorts attitudes and perceptions about the nature of sexual intercourse. Men who habitually look at pornography have a higher tolerance for abnormal sexual behaviors, sexual aggression, promiscuity, and even rape. In addition, men begin to view women and even children as sex objects, commodities or instruments for their pleasure, not as persons with their own inherent dignity.",
        "Did You Know2": "Since pornography encourages sexually permissive attitudes and behavior, users of pornography have a higher likelihood of contracting a sexually transmitted disease or fathering an out-of-wedlock pregnancy. Pornography’s frequent depiction of intercourse without condoms (87 percent of the time) is an invitation for the promiscuous to contract a sexually transmitted disease, to have a child out of wedlock and to have multiple sex partners. Pornography also promotes sexual compulsiveness, which doubles the likelihood of being infected with a sexually transmitted disease.",
        "Did You Know3": "Pornography and “cybersex” are highly addictive and can lead to sexually compulsive behaviors (that decrease a person’s capacity to perform other major tasks in life). Over 90 percent of therapists surveyed in one study believed that a person could become addicted to “cybersex.” In an American survey, 57 percent of frequent viewers used online sexual activity to deal with stress. A 2006 Swedish study of regular Internet pornography users found that about six percent were compulsive users and that these compulsives also used much more non-Internet pornography as well.",
        "Did You Know4": "Pornography is very addictive. The addictive aspect of pornography has a biological substrate, with dopamine hormone release acting as one of the mechanisms for forming the transmission pathway to pleasure centers of the brain. Also, the increased sexual permissiveness engendered by pornography increases the risk of contracting a sexually transmitted disease or of being an unwitting parent in an out-of-wedlock pregnancy.",
        "Did You Know5": "A significant portion of pornography is violent in content. A study of different pornographic media found violence in almost a quarter of magazine scenes, in more than a quarter of video scenes, and in almost half (over 42 percent) of online pornography. A second study found that almost half the violent Internet scenes included nonconsensual sex.",
        "Did You Know6": "The data suggest a modest connection between exposure to pornography and subsequent behavioral aggression, though when men consume violent pornography (i.e. depicting rape or torture), they are more likely to commit acts of sexual aggression. Dangerously, pornography strongly affects psychotic men, who are more likely to act out their impulses.",
        "Did You Know7": "Pornography affects people’s emotional lives. Married men who are involved in pornography feel less satisfied with their marital sexual relations and less emotionally attached to their wives. Women married to men with a pornography addiction report feelings of betrayal, mistrust, and anger. Pornographic use may lead to infidelity and even divorce. Adolescents who view pornography feel shame, diminished self-confidence, and sexual uncertainty.",
        "Did You Know8": "Porn has long been accused of getting between couples’ sex lives. This might be because of the type of porn consumed, according to research that found men who watched more porn were less satisfied with their sex lives. But the opposite was true for women.\n\nResearchers suggest this could be because woman are more likely to watch porn with their partner, instead of alone; and men typically watch less consensual sex acts when watching alone. Another study found that those who watched porn with their partners reported feeling more dedicated and sexually satisfied in their relationship compared to those who watched it alone.",
        "Did You Know9": "One study from the University of Cambridge likened porn addiction to drug addiction, after finding that they both trigger the brain in a similar way.\n\nStraight, male participants – half with compulsive sexual behaviour (CSB) and half without – were asked to rate sexual and non-sexual video clips while they underwent fMRIs. CSB, often referred to as sexual addiction, involves an obsession with sexual thoughts, urges or behaviours that can cause a person distress, and negatively affect their job, relationships and other areas of their life.",
        "Did You Know10": "Porn has long been blamed for fuelling sexist attitudes and setting unrealistic sexual expectations. Research has provided contradictory results, but one study delved deeper. Researchers from the University of Copenhagen and University of California in Los Angeles asked 200 adults about their porn consumption and assessed their personality in terms of agreeableness, which is one of the “big five” personality traits that indicates how altruistic, helpful, trusting and sociable a person is.",
        "Did You Know11": "Chemicals like serotonin and norepinephrine control your moods. High levels are often tied to compulsive sexual behavior, like heavy porn use.",
        "Did You Know12": "If you do get addicted, it could change the way circuits in your brain work. An addiction means you’ll have to view porn over and over again to get the same level of enjoyment.",
        "Did You Know13": "Conditions like epilepsy and dementia, and treatment for Parkinson’s with dopamine, can damage the part of your brain that controls sexual behavior.",
        "Did You Know14": "-40 million adults in the U.S. visit internet pornography sites on a regular basis.\n-1 in 5 internet searches on a mobile device are for pornography.\n-Men who are happily married are 61% less likely to look at porn.\n-20% of men admit to viewing pornography at work.\n-88% of porn scenes contain physical aggression. 49% contain verbal aggression.",

Here’s how -\n\n- Halfway through urination, try to stop or slow down the flow of urine.\n- Don’t tense the muscles in your buttocks, legs, or abdomen, and don’t hold your breath.\n- When you can slow or stop the flow of urine, you’ve successfully located these muscles.\n\nSome find these muscles by imagining that they are trying to stop the passage of gas. Squeezing these muscles gives a pulling sensation, these are the right muscles for pelvic exercises. It's important not to contract other muscles.\n\nWhen you’re first starting, it may be easier to do Kegel exercises lying down, so your muscles aren’t fighting against gravity. It may also be easier to contract the muscles for just two or three seconds at first.\n\nRemember not to tense your buttock, legs, or stomach muscles while you’re doing kegels.",
